a github repository and site for analysis of the BBC Radio 4 programme 'In Our Time', which has been running since 1998.

The basic dataset was established as follows:

The Wikipedia page 'List of In our time programmes' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_In_Our_Time_programmes) was scraped in late 2018, which gave three columns all the way from the start of the series: date/subject/contributors & institutions

The contributors & institutions column was replaced by six columns: one for each of the three contributors and his or her institution
Four columns were added after the programme topic: century, region, genre (culture/history/science/religion/philosophy) and gender of topic-subject (if applicable)
Some cleaning of dataset
Once the data was entered, each season was double-checked for typos or irregularities
